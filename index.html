            <p>
              I am a Research Expert in Location Analysis and Mathematical Programming at KU Leuven, Department of Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
              My expertise lies in identifying Combinatorial Optimization and Operations Research (OR) problems in different real-world contexts, 
			  modeling them through mathematical formulations, and developing efficient and effective methods. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the improvement of the environment and the quality of human life. 
			</p>
            <p>
			  I am particularly interested in addressing challenges in facility location, network design and routing (sequencing) decisions. 
			  Location decisions often also require demand or service allocation decisions. 
			  To name a few specific applications, I have intensively focused on location of emergency facilities, distribution centers or hubs, 
			  electric vehicle recharging stations in combination with routing decisions and low voltage grid restrictions. 
			  I have also developed effective methods for several production planning, scheduling, container loading, angular and irregular cutting problems.
			</p>
            <p>
			  From a methodological point of view, I am specialized in developing efficient mathematical programming-based exact decomposition methods such as Branch-and-Cut and Benders Decomposition. 
			  When developing exact algorithms, I observed that effective integration of efficient lower and upper bounds as well as reduction techniques is an invaluable asset for the success of the algorithms.
			  Further I investigated effectiveness of such improvement techniques when developing heuristics and observed considerable improvements also for the heuristics. 
			  Therefore, my research often focuses on hybrid frameworks combining mathematical models, heuristics (constructive, improvement) and approximation algorithms.

		<p>Investigated the effectiveness of combinatorial bounds into exact and heuristic algorithms.
		Developed mathematical models with high quality relaxation bounds as well as efficient algorithms for several location, routing, scheduling, cutting and packing problems.
		Computationally analyzed the systems under parametric changes and provided managerial insights.
		I published 11 peer-reviewed papers utilizing the bounding and filtering techniques, supervised 1 PhD student and collaborated with many researchers.

		<h3><a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/portaal/#/projecten/3E221205?hl=en&lang=en"target="_blank"> Optimizing the location of electric vehicle charging stations on the low-voltage network </a> (VITO), 2022-2026</h3>
		&nbsp
		
		<p>This is a PhD project which I have been supervising since November 2022. Prior to the official start of the project, I significantly contributed to the proposal writing. 
		The project investigates strategies for location of EV charging stations by taking into account the low-voltage grid (LVG) stability. 
		The approach is novel as the LVG restrictions were never considered when placing charging stations although excessive energy demand could cause undesirable impacts on the grid.
		My expertise in EV charging station location optimization has been a valuable asset in both setting up the goals and work plan as well as the succesful progress of the project so far. 
		This project already led to a journal paper which is currently under review.

		&nbsp
		<p>This is another PhD project which I supervised and has successfully completed in July 2023. 
		In parallel to the combinatorial bounds project, we investigated the integration of aforementioned bounding and filtering methods into heuristics and metaheuristic frameworks to tackle optimization problems with multiple decision levels.
		These levels included two or more of location, routing, scheduling and loading decisions. In addition to supervision, I also contributed with mathematical models and conceptualization of methods and ideas.
		This project led to two journal and three conference papers.

		<h3><a href="https://ordinl.cs.kuleuven.be/"target="_blank">Data-driven logistics - ORDinL</a> (FWO - SBO), 2019-2021 </h3>
		&nbsp
		<p> ORDinL was a strategic basic research (SBO) project with academic partners from KU Leuven (CODeS and DTAI research groups), 
		University of Hasselt (LOG research group), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (MOBI research center) as well as Flanders Institute for Logistics (VIL), 
		as subcontracting partner to ensure the goals are aligned with industry needs. Throughout the project, close interaction with companies was maintained.
		Within this project, I developed efficient data-driven algorithms for several optimization problems. 
		The solution methods largely benefited from the concepts investigated in the "Combiantorial Bounds" project.</p>

	&nbsp
	
     <p> EVERS was a multi-partner project addressing several strategic, tactical and operational challenges in EV ecosystems. 
	 Within this project, I had the opportunity to closely collaborate with researchers from LORIA, Université de technologie de Troyes (France) and University of Kent (the UK).
	 Focused on urban distribution systems utilizing EVs, I developed a mathematical programming model and a Benders Decomposition framework for strategic, tactical and operational decision making. 
     I introduced efficient lower and upper bounds and integrated them into the Benders framework to improve its convergence. 
	 My efforts in this project led to a peer-reviewed paper publicaiton in a highly recognized OR journal.</p>

	&nbsp
	
	<p>E4-share is a European project with partners from University of Vienna, Austrian Institute of Technology, University of Bologna, ULB and tbw research GesmbH (Austria). 
	In this project, I investigated one-way car sharing systems under pre-booked and ad-hoc (uncertain) demand settings. 
	In addition to effective mathematical programming models, I introduced efficient Benders Decomposition algorithms for determining station location and sizing as well as vehicle allocation decisions.
   Several enhancement techniques including stabilization and valid inequalities that I developed provided considerable performance improvements. 
   My research work resulted in 2 peer-reviewed papers indexed in Web of Science Core Collection and two technical reports focusing on demand forecasting methods and heuristics for one-way electric car sharing systems.</p>

		<h2><center>Short-term industrial collaborations</center> </h2>
		&nbsp
		
		
		<h3>Online simulation of an electric car sharing system under demand uncertainty </h3>
		&nbsp
		
		<p> Our collaboration with a company in Flanders which provides car sharing service exclusively with electric cars was during the Spring 2022 semester. 
		The company inroduced their system to my students in the Software Simulation course.
		After receiving a detailed historial data from the company, together with my students we analyzed and modeled the system. 
		The students afterwards developed an <b>online discrete-event system simulation</b> and software visualization to analyze the system under multiple scenarios.</p>
		&nbsp
		
		<h3>Customized algorithms for angular cutting of metal stocks. </h3>
		&nbsp
		
		<p>Industrial manufacturing companies often require materials of irregular shapes to be cut with a non-zero angle. 
		Maximizing yield and minimzing waste are main objectives when cutting such material parts. 
		Prior to this project, no customized algorithms for angular cutting of stocks in batch were available. 
		I developed a sequence-based mathematical programming formulation together with several <b>enhancement techniques, valid inequalities and symmetry breaking constraints</b>. 
		My colleague developed an efficient heuristic algorithm which is able to solve large-scale problem in a matter of seconds. 
		My formulation played a crucial role in the success of the algorithm which has been <b>integrated in the software solution of the company which brought us this project. </b>
		Thanks to the several enhancements to our model, we were able to evaluate and improve the performance of the heuristic considerably.</p>

		&nbsp
		
		<p>In the production environment of a company from the Food Sector, machines can only be utilized under the supervision of trained employees. 
		Preferably, employees rotate among different machines to gain multiple skills. 
		However, they lose their skills if they do not work with a machine for a certain period. If a job cannot be performed by an employee on a certain day, this incurs costs. 
		Therefore, this optimization problem requires minimizing the total cost while ensuring that the production requirements and training restrictions are satisfied.
		I developed a mathematical programming formulation for this problem together with several basic valid inequalities. 
		In order to solve realistic problem instances, my colleague developed a heuristic algorithm and we published our work in a conference proceeding which can be accessed online.</p>

          <h2>Teaching</h2>
		  <p> I have been teaching bachelor and graduate (master and PhD) courses on a wide variety of Operations Research and Industrial Engineering subjects since 2006. 
		  As transfering my knowledge has always been a passion for me, I grabbed the opportunities to teach in four different instutions with different education systems.
		  This page presents a list of the subjects I have taught together with brief details about the topics and course structures. </p>

              <p><em>Software Simulation, Master in Industrial Sciences: Elektronica-ICT</em></p>
              <p> Most real-world systems are prone to uncertainty. 
			  In this course, I teach how to simulate a stochastic system which consists of discrete events such as a new customer request or completion of a service. 
			  I usually invite an industrial collaborator to introduce an interesting case with historical data.  
			  Based on the historical data, the student determine the demand pattern in the form of a probability distribution.
			  Afterwards, the students develop simulation software using Python to analyze the system under different scenarios, rules and restrictions.
				Additionally, they develop visualizations by using the Salabim package or any other library of their choice.
			  </p>
			  <p>In 2022, I re-designed the course and since then I have delivered the lectures individually. 
			  The students obtained very satisfactory outputs and they also evaluated my teaching skills and the content of the course as very good.</p>

              <p> I designed this course by following the Integer Programming book of Laurence Wolsey from UCLouvain. 
			  The course starts by introducing basic modeling techniques for Integer Programs. 
			  It is possible to formulate a real-world problem in multiple ways, but not every formulation will make us happy. 
			  To increase the awareness about this fact, I taught the concept of 'good' and 'ideal' formulations. 
			  The course content evolved towards advanced concepts such as duality, relaxations and valid inequalities as well as more efficient techniques including branch-and-cut and dynamic programming. 
			  </p>
			  <p>I utilize my lecture notes for delivering Integer Programming lectures at KU Leuven as Guest Lecturer.</p>
